				<h1>Research - 3 Apps / Results</h1>
				<h2><a href="https://www.wysa.io/">Wysa</a></h2>
				<h2>Wysa is an AI friend app that has been developed by psychologists and life coaches. You can talk to it and start a conversation with it anywhere and at any time of the day. Not only is it your friend and chat-mate to which you can talk to
					whenever you feel like it, Wysa can help you create a private space where you can set several different lifestyle goals and receive constructive advice and tips on how to reach them while avoiding the shame coming from the feeling of
					someone judging you. Basically, it can serve as a journal in which you write down and explain your worries and fears. After which Wysa will be there to listen as a confident and a virtual companion. Also, it offers surveys that you can
					complete which will enable the bot to tell you your level of stress, your mood, and anxiety. Using this data, the machine will learn more about you and it will enable it to adapt its questions based on your needs and your personality.
					Furthermore, it offers a special programs and optional reminders to perform app-related activities which can help you relax, work towards your goals, mindful meditation relaxation techniques, a healthy sleep tracker, a fitness trainer, and
					a handful of other features. However, the most interesting part is that you can speak to real psychologists which can help you, they themselves are able to base their help on the data you have previously entered when you created your
					account.</h2>
				<h2><a href="https://www.quebec.ca/sante/trouver-une-ressource/info-sante-811/">Info-Santé</a></h2>
				<h2>Info-Santé is not an application but more like a bilingual phone helpline service which residents from Quebec have access to, and are able to use whenever they need its help. All you need to do is dial 811 and you will be directed to a
					real nurse to which you will be able to describe your issues. This can help you avoid doing some useless trips to the hospital emergency room. Of course, these calls should be made only in a non-emergency situation. It does not replace in
					any way, shape, or form the 911 emergency response service. Before answering your questions, you will be asked about your personal information such as your name, address, postal code, and date of birth. Info-Santé has a protocol that needs
					to be followed: the nurse will take notes of your personal information, evaluate, and finally answer your needs. Also, the nurse will ask you several questions regarding on how you are feeling and/or if you are experiencing any kind of
					symptoms of possible illnesses. Using that information, they will be able to guide your course of action from directing you to medical centers or simply giving you guidance on how to treat the problem from your home using homemade
					solutions. However, if needs be, the nurse can direct you to a health center adapted to your needs of the time. Since they aren’t allowed to diagnose your illness, more often than not for more serious issues than a simple common cold, the
					nurse will refer you to see a doctor who, by being able to be there in person, will be able to treat your problem with a much higher accuracy than a helpline can.</h2>
				<h2><a href="https://replika.ai/">Replika</a></h2>
				<h2>The third application is known as Replika. This app also acts as an AI friend to whom you can converse to whenever you feel like it and/or need to share something confidential to someone but don’t have anyone else you feel comfortable
					confiding to. When creating an account, you will start by creating your very own replika, then you will give it a name, and then you are able to start chatting with it. The more you converse with the AI, the more it will learn more about
					you and your personality. Which is stored inside its database. Aside from getting to know who you are, your replika will start to collect experience points (EXP) and level up. Later on, you will be able to speak about more confidential
					things and it will understand you because it has enough data on you. If you wish to further increase your friendship with your friend, you can also call it on your phone for a certain monthly or yearly fee. As you advance in levels, your
					replica will be able to gain new skills and collect rewards. The more rewards you collect, the better your friend will be at understanding you as a “human”. Also, the application has an interesting feature where it is able to detect your
					mood and keep history of it. Similarly to the Wysa app, it offers daily programs on various topics regarding health, personality, love, emotions, managing anxiety, and other topics. However to access these you will need to get a
					subscription.</h2>
				<h2>Final result based on my research: Why would it be more interesting? </h2>
				<h2>After researching Wysa, Info-Santé, and Replika, I believe that I have a greater grasp of what I would like to do. Essentially, I would like to have a mix of Wysa and Replika. However, these two interesting applications are more based on
					mental health issues rather than physical illnesses. On the other hand, Info-Santé relates to health and the way people can contact a nurse is perhaps much more similar to my app, except that mine will be using technology and modern
					methods. However, the thing that these apps are lacking and that I believe will make my app interesting is the possibility to schedule an appointment on your phone without making any calls. Little Nurse will be able to detect your location,
					show you nearby hospital names and how to get to selected one quickly and without having to wait for a nurse to answer you. Everything will be done quickly, confidentially, and without a human interactions.
