				<h1>More In-Depth</h1>
				<h2>Relationship</h2>
				<h2>The relationship that I wish to build between the user and this application is to make the user realize that there are other resources that can be used instead of waiting in the emergency room or on the phone for hours to see a doctor and
					book an appointment. With a few clicks, the user will be able to be diagnosed by Little Nurse and even have an appointment already booked in just a few minutes. Therefore, this will help the user reflect on what can be done to improve our
					healthcare systems and even give ideas to our community to implement new future tools that could be inspired from small initiatives to create something even greater and much more useful than Little Nurse. This application will not only
					destabilize the user but even the healthcare clinics. With the creation of these kind of applications, it should bring awareness to the Quebec healthcare industry that the current system that they are using is outdated and not helpful to
					our communities and it's time to make a change. Also, since we are living in an age of technology, clinics should perhaps rely more devices or bots that could filter hundreds of patients with different health issues and help real nurses to
					distinguish the minor causes from the major ones which are truly considered emergencies and are worth to be taken into serious care. To sum up, this application will mainly help people reflect on what's going on in their society and push
					the healthcare centers to come up with a better healthcare system. </h2>
				<h2>Empowerment</h2>
				<h2>As mentioned above, the space will be able to help its users access the necessary information needed, along with tips and tricks on how to cure their illnesses and/or seek further medical help; such as booking appointments at their
					nearby hospitals or clinics. In terms of teaching, this application will teach people to identify their own illnesses to the point that they might no longer need the application anymore or at least they will not be using it for non
					emergency issues. Therefore, this could be considered a step toward modernizing the outdated Quebecâ€™s health care system. Also, this application will challenge the current healthcare system by letting the users reflect on how the system
					works. It might also enable the users to realize that there might be better solutions or ways to improve the accessibility to proper care to those who desperately need it while also filtering the non-urgent requests. As mentioned above,
					Little Nurse would empower the users but it hopefully would also make the health industry reflect on their current emergency system. It could also serve as a basis from which to rebuild their own system using up-to-date technology which
					could bridge and/or close the gap between the the overflowing emergency rooms and the current capacity at which doctors are able to go through patients. Finally, Little Nurse could create room as a first initiative for collaboration
					between hospitals and software developing companies that would create high quality apps for both higher efficiency rates on the processing of patients as well as giving access to hospitals to the data collected by said apps.
