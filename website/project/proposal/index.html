        <h2>For this project, the starting topic that I would like to explore is the relationship between health and technology. Being healthy is one of the most important aspects to our lives. If we are not healthy, we cannot contribute to our
          society or help our families. However, our healthcare in Quebec is not the greatest and sometimes it is hard for clinics to manage hundreds of patients everyday. As a result, the waiting time is much longer and patients have to wait for
          hours before seeing a nurse no matter the nature of the emergency. This is a big issue and therefore, I took the initiative to design and create a tool which could help unclog our emergency system. That is being said, for this project I
          would like to create a healthcare chat box called Little Nurse which can diagnose a userâ€™s illness by asking several questions about their symptoms. Also, if the application fails to diagnose or if the user has a serious condition, the user
          will be able to ask the chat bot, which detects nearby hospitals, where and when the user will be able to schedule an appointment request in just a few clicks. Finally, as a designer and programmer, I believe that making this an explorable
          networked space is important because taking the initiative to design an idea that could help our healthcare centers is another step towards a prosperous society where people could be treated much faster without waiting in line for hours.
